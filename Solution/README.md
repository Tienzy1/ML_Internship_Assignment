# Solution

This folder contains two files; The python code that I used to solve this problem and the resulting dataset.

## Method

Since I have been provided with a .csv file containing examples of Technical(Hard) Skills, I compared the Example file with the Raw skills file and wrote matching skills into a new file(Hard_Skills_Dataset.csv). 
The solution reads both files in one pass and prints common lines regardless of their position in the file.
