# Solution

This folder contains two files; The python code that I used to solve this problem (hard_skills.py) and the resulting dataset(Hard_Skills_Dataset.csv).

## Method

Since I have been provided with a dataset containing examples of Technical(Hard) Skills along with the Raw skills dataset, I compared the Example file with the Raw skills file using the *intersection()* method and wrote matching skills into a new file(Hard_Skills_Dataset.csv). 

The solution reads both files in one pass and prints common lines regardless of their position in the file.
